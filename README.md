# pbuilder

**Your product is already telling you what to build next.**

The teams that win aren't the ones who hear it first — they're the ones who act on it in the same breath. pbuilder puts a Claude skill at every turn of that loop: discover what's worth solving, validate before committing, launch with confidence, measure what landed.

Signal to decision to impact. Hours, not weeks.

Every skill is backed by live data from your Pendo subscription.

Works with Claude Code and Cowork.

## How it works

Each skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` file. Claude reads it as a slash command and calls the Pendo MCP for live data. No hardcoded queries, no stale exports — everything runs against your subscription in real time.
